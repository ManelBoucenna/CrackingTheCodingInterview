1- Negative numbers = ( 1 sign bit) + (complementaty bits)
  a- complementary bit in K bits= invert bit of the abs(number) + 1. Ex: comp(3) in 4 bits= ~0011 +1 = 1100+1 = 1101
  b- -3 in 5 bits= (1) + (1101)
2- Arithmetic Shift is division by 2. We keep the sign
3- Logical right shift is classic shift.
