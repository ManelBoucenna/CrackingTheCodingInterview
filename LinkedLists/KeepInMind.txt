Notes:
1-Linked lists are used when:
  a- Don't know how many items you have
  b- Don't need random access to an element (using index)
  c- Constant insert/delete time (anywhere in the linked list thanks to head but not at a specific position in the linked list it becomes O(n))
2- To delete middle node (eg.: c) in Linked List having only access to it (c):
  a-  a->b->(c)->d->e
  b-  a->b->(d)->d->e
  c-  a->b->(d)->e
3- To return Kth element from the end and we don't have the size of list, we use two pointers separated by k spaces.
4- To check palindrome we can:
  a- Store in an array then compare
  b- Reverse list and compare
  c- Store in a string than reverse it and compare it
