Stacks:
1- LIFO: last-in-first-out
2- Are often used in recursive algorithms.
3- To find the min of a stack we use a data structure where each node keep the value of the min before it.
  eg:
    data: 1 -> 2 -> -1 -> 5 (top)
    next: 2-> -1-> 5-> None
    min:  1 -> 1-> -1 -> -1
    


Queues:
1- FIFO: first-in-first-out
2- Are used as cache, in breadth-first search (recherche en largeur) to store each node and its adjacent in order to process it
